            <p>I'm a creative director and front-end developer in the Boulder area with 10+ years creating outstanding user experiences.
                I have built a reputation for bringing sophisticated simplicity and thoughtful details into my design.</p><br />

            <p>In an age where technology has replaced human interaction, my passion lies in bringing humanistic values back to technology.</p><br />

            <p>Proficient in UI/UX Design, CX Design Practice, Graphic Design, Web Design,
                Web Development, and Product Management.</p><br />

            <p>Being a Colorado native, I'm an avid hiker of our beautiful Rocky Mountains.
                In my spare time I'm a wildlife photographer and birder.
                I enjoy everything travel-related and try to visit a new place each year.
                And of course, nothing beats a good cup of coffee!</p><br />
